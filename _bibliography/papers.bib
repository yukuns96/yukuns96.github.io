        abstract = {We study the flow physics underlying the recently developed remote sensing capability of detecting oceanic microplastics, which is based on the measurable surface roughness reduction induced by the presence of microplastics on the ocean surface. In particular, we are interested in whether this roughness reduction is caused by the microplastics as floating particles, or by surfactants which follow similar transport paths as microplastics. For this purpose, we experimentally test the effects of floating particles and surfactants on surface roughness, quantified by the mean square slope (MSS), with waves generated by a mechanical wave maker or by wind. For microplastics, we find that their effect on MSS critically depends on the surface area fraction of coverage. The damping by particles is observed only for fractions above O (5â€“10\%), much higher than the realistic ocean condition. For surfactants, their damping effects on both mechanically generated waves and wind waves are quantified, which are shown to be much more significant than that by microplastics. Several new mechanisms/relations for roughness damping by surfactants are also identified. The implications of these experimental results to remote sensing are discussed.},

	abstract = {Whirligig beetles (Gyrinidae) are the fastest-swimming insects. The one-centimeter long aquatic beetle can reach a peak acceleration of 100 m s?2 and a top velocity of 100 body lengths per second. Previous studies have suggested that drag-based thrust by their hind legs is responsible for their propulsion1,2,3,4. For the drag-based thrust to be effective, however, the leg stroke velocity must exceed the swimming velocity. Therefore, for fast-swimming whirligigs, it is unlikely that the drag-based thrust is the main source of acceleration5. Here, we demonstrate that lift-based thrust enables the rapid swimming of the whirligigs.},
